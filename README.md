# Max's Shell Scripts
Bash and Z shell scripts I wrote and want to keep around

## Scripts
### accio.sh
Shorthand command for running `git update-index --no-assume-unchanged` with some Harry Potter flavor

### guppy.zsh
Just runs `git fetch`, then `git pull`... it's quick and I'm lazy

### mergeupdate.zsh
Checks out the branch you're planning to merge into during a PR, fetches the newest changes, then merges them into the branch you're currently working on

### yeet.sh
Shorthand command for running `git update-index --assume-unchanged` with a little bit of early 2010s Vine flavor
