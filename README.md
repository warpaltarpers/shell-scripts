# Max's Shell Scripts
Bash and Z shell scripts I wrote and want to keep around

## Scripts
### accio.sh
Shorthand command for running `git update-index --no-assume-unchanged` with some Harry Potter flavor

### yeet.sh
Shorthand command for running `git update-index --assume-unchanged` with a little bit of early 2010s Vine flavor
